"Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (19 age groups - Census P25-1130).The Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software, Version 4.9, March 2021, National Cancer Institute.The APC's/AAPC's direction is 'Rising' when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, 'Falling' when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered 'Not Significant'."
"For years prior to 1990, the Census Bureau has only provided county-level population estimates for White, Black, and Other races."
