"SEER 22 areas (San Francisco, Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, New Mexico, Seattle, Utah, Atlanta, San Jose-Monterey, Los Angeles, Alaska Native Registry, Rural Georgia, California excluding SF/SJM/LA, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, Georgia excluding ATL/RG, Idaho, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois and Texas)."
"Rates are per 100,000 and are age-adjusted to the 2000 US Std Population (19 age groups - Census P25-1130).The Annual Percent Change (APC) and Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) estimates were calculated from the underlying rates using the Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software, Version 4.9, March 2021, National Cancer Institute.The APC's/AAPC's direction is 'Rising' when the entire 95% confidence interval (C.I.) is above 0, 'Falling' when the entire 95% C.I. is lower than 0, otherwise, the trend is considered 'Not Significant'."
"Rates for American Indians/Alaska Natives only include cases that are in a Purchased/Referred Care Delivery Area (PRCDA). Incidence data for Hispanics and Non-Hispanics are based on the NAACCR Hispanic Latino Identification Algorithm (NHIA). For more details on SEER race/ethnicity groupings and changes made to the grouping for this year's data release, please see Race and Hispanic Ethnicity Changes."
