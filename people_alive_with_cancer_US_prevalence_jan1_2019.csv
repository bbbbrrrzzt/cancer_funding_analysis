"US 2019 cancer prevalence estimates are based on 2019 cancer prevalence proportions from the SEER 12 Areas and 1/1/2019 US population estimates based on the average of 2018 and 2019 population estimates from the US Bureau of the Census. The Alaska Native Tumor Registry only includes cases diagnosed among Alaska Natives and is excluded from the analysis to avoid bias in the underlying calculations."
"Cases diagnosed more than 27 years ago were estimated using the completeness index method (Capocaccia et. al. 1997,Merrill et. al. 2000).For more information on prevalence, please see Cancer Prevalence Statistics Overview"
"Complete prevalence for White and Black races can be obtained from the Cancer Query System."
